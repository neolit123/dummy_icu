important:

this source code provides methods for replacements of official
dynamic libraries released either under the MIT and LGPL licenses.
the source code in this package is released in the public domain (see LICENSE),
which makes it compatible, but mind that it may be _violating_
the aforementioned licenses. also it may have other disruptive effects
given the essence of the modification.

use at your own risk.

================================================================================
motivation and execution:

provided is a replacement for the large ICU DLLs when you distribute
your Qt5.x.x application, but when you have downloaded Qt pre-built with
ICU support - i.e. you haven't compiled Qt yourself.

ICU is a pretty large library; the SVN source code at their repository with
all the branches is at near 2gb or more. Qt is pretty large itself
and compiling it is quite the task for one's machine, so a lot of users
tend to download the precompiled binaries, which usually contain the full
package.

if you have downloaded Qt pre-built, you may have noticed that it has one
especially big file (~17mb) called icudtXX.dll on which your
applications will depend on. this file contains the ICU static
localization data, which is massive. another file is icuinXX.dll
which exposes ICU "attribute control" and some other methods to Qt.

if we aren't interested much in localization for an app, perhaps we can
disable the dependencies by tricking Qt with dummy dynamic libraries.
to do that we explore the original exported DLL methods and define some
blank NOP analogues for our dummy DLLs.

================================================================================
building and installation:

1) open Makefile and set ICU_VER to the version of ICU you are targetting
2) call 'make' in the source folder
(if you are using Qt with MSVC call 'make -f Makefile.msvc') 
3) backup icudtXX.dll and icuinXX.dll in your project directory
4) copy the resulted DLLs from ./bin to your project directory

================================================================================
what won't work:

the short answer is icudtXX.dll, icuinXX.dll related calls, but the truth is
i haven't examined much in there. if the method names are descriptive enough
my guess is only the "actual" localization-data part won't work.
unicode conversations should be still possible via icuucXX.dll, which we
leave unaffected. as long as you don't replace icuucXX.dll with the NOP
version, unicode text should be handled fine and it shouldn't break QtCore.

i'm pretty certain webkit will not work.
